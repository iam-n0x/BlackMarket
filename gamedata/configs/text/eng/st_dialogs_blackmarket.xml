		<text>Are you crazy? The military already harass me enough as it is. Besides, what are the rookies around here gonna do if I sell them some fancy shooter? Just go and get themselves killed by the Monolith. Go find someone else.</text>
	</string>
        <string id="blackmarket_no_2">
		<text>Nevermind then. Forget I asked.</text>

		<text>You interested in trading any weapons?</text>
	</string>
        <string id="blackmarket_wp_1_1">
		<text>Yes, but don't bother bringing me anything fancy. I need cheap, reliable Russian firearms. The stalkers around here can't afford anything better. Make sure they're fixed up.</text>

		<text>Yes, I need the finest firearms the Motherland has to offer. Guys around here need all the firepower they can get. And they've got to be pristine! A jam out here will get you killed in a second.</text>
